# Sequence-Generator
Firstly download the computer project files to your device
Then sequence programs -> functions -> main.py (file to run)

For the mail sending purposes, you would need to access your mail through python
As it is a third party app, we need to create an app password for python to be able to access your account to send mails
First complete the 2-step verification in your gmail account
Then for generating the app password go to the following link

This project uses python mysql connectivity, pyttsx3 module (for speech) and smtplib (for mail-sending)
So you need to have a valid sql server for the project to work
Also install pyttsx3 through terminal or powershell depending on your operating system

Now follow the following steps before running the program:
Line 18 -> enter your sql password
Line 246,292,335,370,471,553 -> enter mail id through which you want to send the email (the one you used to create the app password)
Line 247,293,336,371,472,554 -> enter the app password generated earlier for the same account
Line 284,287,325,329 -> modify and enter your device's path to shell_window.txt
Line 380,481,565 -> modify and enter your device's path to fibonaccinumbers.txt
Line 392,490,576 -> modify and enter your device's path to primenumbers.txt
Line 404,499,587 -> modify and enter your device's path to collatz sequence.txt
Line 416,508,598 -> modify and enter your device's path to pascal triangle numbers.txt
Line 428,517,609 -> modify and enter your device's path to pentagonal numbers.txt
Line 440,526,620 -> modify and enter your device's path to fermat numbers.txt
