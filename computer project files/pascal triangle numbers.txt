
> Pascal Triangle Numbers:
- To build Pascal's Triangle, we need to start with '1' at the top then continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern.
- Each number is the numbers directly above it added together.

				1
			      1   1
			    1	2   1
			  1   3   3   1
			1   4   6   4   1
				
- Within the triangle, one can find many interesting number patterns such as the Triangular numbers, Fibonacci numbers, Tetrahedral numbers and etc.
- The Pascal triangle numbers have many applications from finding the probability of the head or tail coin face appearing for any no. of attempts, to finding the coefficients of the terms in the binomial expansion.
- Although Blaise Pascal is known to have first discovered the pattern, it was first discovered more than two centuries before he did.
