
> Collatz Sequence:
- The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: 
 (i) start with any postive integer n.
 (ii) Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
      Else, if the previous term is odd, the next term is three times the previous term plus 1.
- It is also called as the Hailstone sequence.
